			<h1>Happiness: It Is Not What You May Think About</h1>

			<p class="tebal">Who does not want to be happy? Nobody;</p>
			<p>We are all desperately waiting for happiness. Another question: who knows what happiness is? Nobody, I guess. Then why do we want to be happy if we do not know what happiness is exactly?</p>
			<p>A boy went to a market to buy apples; he was a schoolboy at the time. He would listen up his mother's advice and respect every word uttered through her mouth. When he went to a market, he came across a salesperson. The salesperson had a number of fruits. When the boy saw the fruits, he could not believe his eyes; he was somehow confused by the similarities of the fruits. He was particularly looking for apples, but the salesperson had a number of apples, which made it difficult for his choice. After wondering for a while, he bought two pounds of red apples because he thought that red apples are the ordinary ones that most people would prefer to buy. He went home, but his mother did not approve it. She stared at him puzzled for a couple of minutes.</p>
			<p>"What is wrong mother?" the boy asked.</p>
			<p>"Have you lost your mind?" she reacted.</p>
			<p>"I am sane and applied my best knowledge when I bought it," he answered politely.</p>
			<p>"These are not apples; they are Ping-Pong balls; I did not know that you started eating plastic balls," she shocked him.</p>
			<p>This is the situation in the pursuit of happiness. We think we know what happiness is, but unfortunately we eat counterfeit happiness. A mistake or ignorance is always alright and natural too, but learning to negate it, is absolutely optional; nobody will force you to learn and become wise. Happiness is not an emotional wellness or contentment, but rather wisdom.</p>
			<p class="tebal">Age is compulsory, but wisdom is option. -Carroll Bryant</p>
			<p>A dog knows only one owner in life; it does not change an owner whatsoever. It does not matter for a dog whether its owner is kind or cruel; just ownership forever. If the owner is kind, both the dog ad owner enjoy a wonderful companion, whereas if the owner is cruel, the dog suffers too much and cannot go against; after all he is his own</p>
			<p>Back to us: Who is our owner? Are we owned or owners? This is a million dollar question we should ask before setting off a pursuit of happiness. We are no more dogs; we are well equipped; we got everything: science, knowledge, wisdom, philosophy and people, among others. As a personal advice, I would promote folks to look within and find out where one is chained. That is the beginning of liberation; otherwise freedom. If one does not know, where he or she is imprisoned, it may take an eternity to be liberated. I am not talking about a particular geographical jail, but rather who raised you up; what fed you mentally or simply who introduced you to life at the very beginning of your curiosity or exploration? Questions are dry, but they are the ones that lead us to water or heaven, and thus ask question after question. If you are afraid of asking questions, I do not think there will be a messiah to liberate you. Even if there is a messiah, he needs your cooperation or willingness in this matter to liberate you.</p>
