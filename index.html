				<p>Let's be truthfully honest: Are you happy with your life or do you wish things were different? For example, how would a life coach evaluate it? Would they make adjustments here and there or give you their sign of approval? Sometimes we allow our negative emotions to get in the way of what life is trying to tell us. We might see our friends or those on Instagram living wonderful lives and wish ours was the same. Though we are not looking at things objectively but judging it on appearances alone. No matter how successful, rich or happy you are, there will always be challenges and no one is immune from them. Does it make sense that wishing for a better life doesn't bring it into existence? It requires picking apart what is not working and attending to those details consistently. <a target="_blank" href="stop.html">read more</a></p>

				<p class="tebal">"He who has a why to live can bear with almost any how" -Friedrich Nietzsche</p>
				<p>Have you ever been in a situation where you carry on with your life, perhaps you have a job, you get up every morning go to work, come back to your family and carry this on for a year or two and all of a sudden one day on a lonely day or a quite day you feel empty and ask yourself "Why, What and Who?" Why do you do the things you do? What do you live for? Who are you? and what do you really what to accomplish. Such a feeling of emptiness and questioning yourself is usually a self-reflection point in your life. Life can get routinal and at times we live on autopilot every day and forget the purpose regarding our lives. This in a long term or even short term can leave us feeling empty without hope. <a target="_blank" href="remember.html">read more</a></p>
